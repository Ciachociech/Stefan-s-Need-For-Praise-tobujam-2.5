# Project for itch.io's ToBuJam 2.5 (https://itch.io/jam/tobujam-2dot5)

Simple Tamagotchi-like game with base economic system, keep needs at reasonable level of virtual rabbit (Stefan).
Time outside game is also counted and needs are decaying in real-time, so don't forget to care of this beloved pet.
There is included also one mini game, unfortunately I wasn't able to create two more. 
I also wanted to add two short animations for feed/pet/clean actions, but there is only a simple info about needs change.
I don't plan to improve this game, there is a little chance to fix critical bugs.
